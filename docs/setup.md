# External setup

Status: production resources are not provisioned. Do not deploy the local placeholder database ID or the localhost origin.

## Cloudflare

From this repository, with Node.js 24 active:

```sh
npx wrangler login
npx wrangler whoami
```

Complete browser authorization using the account that owns slowmass.com. Keep tokens out of chat and source control. The implementation agent can then inspect the account, create the D1 database and private R2 bucket, replace the placeholder binding, and configure the production origin/domain. R2 may require billing activation even within free allowances; complete any account-owner action in Cloudflare's dashboard.

The Images binding is deliberately not configured until private processing and free-plan availability can be tested. No production deployment or paid subscription is enabled by this scaffold.

## Email delivery

Create a Resend account on its Free plan. Add slowmass.com as a sending domain and install its verification DNS records in Cloudflare. Keep open and click tracking disabled. Create a sending-only API key scoped to that domain where supported.

In the ignored `.dev.vars` file, enter the API key and your desired sending address. Set `BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL` to the address you will use for the first account. Its first successful email verification establishes the root member. Once any membership exists, this setting cannot create another root. Every later member requires an active member's invitation.

The implementation agent has generated a local auth secret in `.dev.vars`. On a fresh checkout, copy `.dev.vars.example` and generate one using `openssl rand -base64 32`. Do not paste credentials into chat. Production secrets must be installed through Wrangler's secret input; production needs a distinct auth secret and verified HTTPS origin.

Use the actual sender domain/address verified by Resend. The provider's sandbox sender cannot deliver broadly to friends. The application caps email delivery attempts below the provider's current free daily allowance; provider billing settings remain authoritative. Do not enable automatic paid overages as part of setup.

## Migrations

`npm run db:migrate` applies checked-in migrations to local D1. The auth schema is generated from the installed Better Auth library; membership and email-budget migrations are application-owned. `npm run auth:schema` prints a reference auth schema for review without applying it. Do not replace an applied migration; add forward migrations when the schema changes.

## Next verification gate

After credentials are available, verify a real email link, first-member bootstrap, invited/uninvited joins, logout, private image processing, metadata removal, rejected formats, and deployed Worker CPU consumption. Local simulated email tests do not substitute for hosted delivery or runtime verification. Keep that implementation-plan gate open until observed.
